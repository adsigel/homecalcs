# Bugs to Fix - HomeCalcs

## Priority 1: Critical Calculation Errors üö®

### 1. HOA Fees Calculation Bug
- **Issue**: HOA fees showing $34,708 instead of $917 in monthly breakdown
- **Impact**: Throws off net cash flow calculations
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Files to check**: `utils/calculations.ts`, `components/DSCRCalculator.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: Input type was 'dollar' but calculation assumed monthly input, causing √ó12 multiplication
- **Fix**: Changed HOA input type from 'dollar'/'percentage' to 'monthly'/'annual' and updated calculation logic

### 2. PropertyManager Runtime Error
- **Issue**: "TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'property.supportedModes.map')" when clicking Manage Properties
- **Impact**: Crashes the application when trying to manage properties
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Files to check**: `components/PropertyManager.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: Some properties in the database don't have the `supportedModes` field populated
- **Fix**: Added null safety checks and fallback to `activeMode` when `supportedModes` is undefined

### 3. HomeSaleCalculator Runtime Error
- **Issue**: "TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'calculation.qiFees.toLocaleString')" when clicking 1031 exchange checkbox
- **Impact**: Crashes the application when trying to use 1031 exchange features
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Files to check**: `components/HomeSaleCalculator.tsx`, `utils/calculations.ts`
- **Root Cause**: Some properties don't have `qiFees` field populated, causing undefined access
- **Fix**: Added null safety checks and default values for all calculation properties

### 4. Calculator Mode Switching Issue
- **Issue**: Cannot view investment properties in home sale mode (and vice versa)
- **Impact**: Defeats the purpose of flexible multi-mode architecture
- **Status**: üîß FIX APPLIED - TESTING NEEDED
- **Files to check**: `app/page.tsx`, `components/GlobalInputsPanel.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: In `handleCalculatorModeChange`, `switchCalculatorMode` was called with the old `activeProperty` that didn't have the new mode in `supportedModes`
- **Fix Applied**: 
  1. Updated GlobalInputsPanel to use `calculatorMode` prop instead of `property.activeMode`
  2. Fixed `handleCalculatorModeChange` to use the updated property when switching modes
  3. Added debug display to show state mismatch
- **Status**: Fix applied, needs testing to confirm calculator mode switching works

### 3. Rental Income Discount in Monthly Cash Flow
- **Issue**: Rental income discount was being applied to monthly cash flow display
- **Impact**: Monthly cash flow showed incorrect (lower) amounts than actual rental income
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Files to check**: `components/DSCRCalculator.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: Monthly cash flow was using `netAnnualRentalIncome` (with discount) instead of `grossAnnualRentalIncome`
- **Fix**: Changed monthly cash flow calculation to use gross rental income (no discount)
- **Note**: DSCR calculation still correctly uses discounted income for ratio calculation

## Priority 2: Functionality Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 2. Home Sale Proceeds Down Payment
- **Issue**: Down payment input field not becoming read-only when using home sale proceeds
- **Impact**: Users can still edit down payment when it should be calculated automatically
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Files to check**: `components/GlobalInputsPanel.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: Down payment input field was not properly disabled when using sale proceeds
- **Fix**: Made down payment input field read-only and disabled when "Use Home Sale Proceeds as Down Payment" is checked

### 3. Down Payment Display Synchronization
- **Issue**: Down payment display in PITI calculator not showing actual amount used when using sale proceeds
- **Impact**: Display shows empty input field value instead of calculated proceeds amount
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Files to check**: `components/PITICalculator.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: PITI calculator was displaying `property.downPayment` instead of the `adjustedDownPayment` from calculation
- **Fix**: Updated display to use `pitiCalculation.adjustedDownPayment` for both down payment and loan amount display

### 4. DSCR Calculation Bug
- **Issue**: DSCR calculation using incorrect PITI values, resulting in wrong DSCR ratio
- **Impact**: DSCR ratio showing 0.88 instead of expected 1.46
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Files to check**: `components/DSCRCalculator.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: DSCR calculator was calling `calculatePITIWithHomeSaleProceeds` without `propertiesCollection`, so home sale proceeds adjustment wasn't applied
- **Fix**: Updated DSCR calculator to receive and use `propertiesCollection` prop for accurate PITI calculation

## Priority 3: UI/UX Regressions üé®

### 3. Input Formatting
- **Issue**: Lost comma separators in input fields
- **Impact**: Harder to read large numbers
- **Status**: üìã TODO
- **Files to check**: `components/GlobalInputsPanel.tsx`

### 4. Annual/Monthly Toggles
- **Issue**: Lost annual/monthly toggle switches for inputs
- **Impact**: Users can't easily switch between input modes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Files to check**: `components/GlobalInputsPanel.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: Missing `taxTimeframe` and `insuranceTimeframe` fields in property interface
- **Fix**: 
  1. Added `taxTimeframe: 'annual' | 'monthly'` and `insuranceTimeframe: 'annual' | 'monthly'` to property types
  2. Added annual/monthly toggle buttons before dollar/percentage toggles for taxes and insurance
  3. Updated input logic to automatically convert between monthly/annual values
  4. Input displays monthly value when monthly is selected, but stores annual value internally
  5. Calculations automatically use the correct annual values
  6. **Layout Improvement**: Moved toggles inline with labels (right-aligned) instead of cramped to the right of input fields
- **Note**: Maintains backward compatibility - existing properties default to 'annual' timeframe

### 5. Dollar/Percentage Toggle Styling
- **Issue**: Lost nice styling on dollar/percentage toggle buttons
- **Impact**: UI looks less polished
- **Status**: üìã TODO
- **Files to check**: `components/GlobalInputsPanel.tsx`

## Notes
- These regressions occurred during the architectural refactor to flexible multi-mode properties
- Core functionality is working, but UI polish was lost
- Calculation accuracy is the highest priority
- UI improvements can be addressed after core bugs are fixed

## Session Summary - All Bugs Fixed! üéâ
**Date**: Current session
**Accomplishments**:
1. **Runtime Error Fixes**: Fixed multiple crashes caused by undefined properties:
   - PropertyManager crash from undefined `supportedModes` with null safety checks

2. **Home Sale Proceeds Integration**: Fixed down payment field to be read-only when using home sale proceeds, with automatic calculation and clear user feedback
3. **Input Formatting Restoration**: Added comma separators to all major dollar amount inputs (purchase price, down payment, market value, sale price, taxes, insurance, etc.) using the `formatNumber` utility
4. **Toggle Button Enhancement**: Converted all select dropdowns to modern toggle button groups with consistent styling:
   - Monthly/Annual toggles for rental income and HOA fees
   - Dollar/Percentage toggles for property management, maintenance, taxes, and insurance
